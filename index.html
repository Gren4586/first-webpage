		<h1>Welcome to my first webpage</h1>
		<p>This is my first venture into HTML. It's weird seeing something come to life like this.</p>
		
		<h2>This is a test heading</h2>
		<p>Learning about opening and closing tags</p>
		
		<h3>This is also a test heading</h3>
		<p>Was taught how to declare the document type</p>
		
		<h4>This is another test heading</h4>
		<p>The body is where the content to be viewed on the webpage goes</p>
		
		<h5>This is yet another test heading</h5>
		<p>The head is where metadata goes, like the character set</p>
		
		<h6>This is a final test heading</h6>
		<p>Spacing is important to make it readable to the humans, but the computer could read it all on one line.</p>
